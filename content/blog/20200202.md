ORM(Object-Relational Mapper), which automatically generates and executes SQL statements without writing them directly, is used in various frameworks such as Rails, Hibernate, and Spring as a technology that makes programming easier.

On the other hand, the SQL generated by ORMs can sometimes be complex or inefficient, leading to slow database processing.

The characteristic of ORM is that the generation and execution of SQL statements do not need to be written explicitly as code, which makes it difficult to investigate why the database processing has become slow, what SQL statements are generated, and where the cause lies.

In order to solve such issues, Google has released "[sqlcommenter](https://google.github.io/sqlcommenter/)" as an open source software(see the blog "[Introducing Sqlcommenter: An open source ORM auto-instrumentation library](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/introducing-sqlcommenter-open-source-orm-auto-instrumentation-library)")
